# Hidden dependency
## Introduction

This work is an artistic research and experiment about dependent origination. According to this notion, a single event or being reflects only a fragment of the whole world and time, so that we can approximate a closer picture of the complex interconnection between every entity and its dependency by reassembling pieces of the whole.
