# Hidden dependency (Teensy4.0 Board)

**_Frequency generator for 3 speakers connected to a Teensy 4.0 board with 2 Audio-shield rev D. This code allows the Teensy board 4.0 to generate certain frequencies for 3 speakers to draw laser patterns on the wall. It also has functions to interact between audiences and the device with a microphone module._**

## Introduction

This work is an artistic research and experiment about dependent origination. According to this notion, a single event or being reflects only a fragment of the whole world and time, so we can approximate a closer picture of the complex interconnection between every entity and its dependency by reassembling pieces of the whole.

We only see a part of the surroundings we live in. This experienced world is composed not only of ourselves but also of the unnoticed beings that surround us. Machines cover our living spaces and communicate with each other, yet we don't perceive their existence since machines are concealed, and use different language from ours. Therefore, we consider them not worthy to pay attention until they are not working properly. This apathy makes us difficult to draw the whole picture of the moment we are experiencing.

## Interaction diagram
This device produces the laser projection triggered by the Bluetooth signals nearby and reveals imperceptible but surely existing communication between machines that construct the moment in the area. When the audience reacts to the sound and laser pattern, the machine stops producing signals and becomes quiet. The machine starts talking only when people stop engaging and become silent and calm.
